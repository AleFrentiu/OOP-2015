# Chapter 2 - Controls

## Objective
Experiment different controls. 

## Deadline
Fifth OOP Lab (week 5 of school year) 

## Important notes:
- Before everything, download and install [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download) and make sure that you will run every application on a virtual machine created in Genymotion. You can find a simple installing and usage guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU75HgTwtJY)
- Do not use Eclipse for Android development! Always prefer Android Studio (as you'll see in the tutorials)
- Research your own reading/viewing material. [Learn 2 Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Googling+is+easy.+See%3F).
